        "description": "We've sold this wine for thirty years, and for that whole time it's been a bestseller. Why's it so popular? White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Maconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Cotes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn't have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Macon, and Latour one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken. It's proof that sometimes it pays to stick with the old favourites.",

They've more than succeeded â€“ and they're now regarded as Shiraz experts. 'Angels' Share' was one of their very first wines. Its name refers to the small amount of wine that evaporates from oak barrels during maturation, which mediaeval winemakers believed angels took as they watched over their wines. It's brilliantly bold and flavoursome, a full-on Australian Shiraz, with a silky texture and smooth tannins. Flavours of blueberry, dried herbs and a hint of game are ideal for barbecued meats.",

But he had another request. Fearful of an assassination attempt, he asked that it be produced in a clear bottle with no indent, called a 'punt', in the bottom. And an icon was born. It's made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes. Rich and velvety, it has intense and complex notes of ripe citrus, golden apple and almond pastry with an incredibly long and elegant finish.",

      "description": "This complex Italian rose first hit our shelves in small, limited supply. Our customers loved it so much, we soon went back for more. It's made by Pasqua, a historic family-run winery who are behind some of our best-selling bottles. So you can be sure you're in for something delicious. It's made from Corvina, Trebbiano, Syrah and Carmenere grapes, which all thrive in Pasqua's beautiful Veneto-based vineyards. Its name comes from the length of time the juice is left on the grape skins for exactly 11 minutes, the perfect amount of time to give the wine its delicate rosy colour. It's elegant and subtly spicy, with plenty of red-fruit flavours. Transport yourself to Italy by pairing it with baked white fish, olives and tomatoes.",
