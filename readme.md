### Introduction

Oenotrus is a full stack web application designed for the Unit 4 project in the Code Institute Gateway Qualifications Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development course. It provides the user (browsers, shoppers and wine enthusiasts) with a fully functional online store presenting a small range of handpicked wines covering some of the most popular categories in the market.

As a B2C e-commerce platform Oenotrus provides the framework for business users to present, market and sell their stock of wines direct to consumers, who are able to browse, select and purchase the available wines online in an aesthetically pleasing, responsive and fully functional website across all common devices and browsers.

The live website can be found here <https://oenotrus-b46392d15346.herokuapp.com/>

### Structure

##### Architecture

Gym Logger is built with HTML5, custom CSS, JavaScript and Python in the Django full-stack framework to create a responsive and interactive full-stack web application which also contains back-end functionality that allows users to create, store and manipulate relevant data records.

##### User Experience Design

For first time users I want the site to be easily navigable and the products easily browsable, laid out in a clear, concise and yet attractive way combining sufficient information and CTAs to satisfy the business user's desire to sell and the customer's desire to make an informed purchase.

For first time users I want to offer simple functionality to create an account and store their information including order history, default delivery details and wishlisted products. This will facilitate new purchases for the business user

For returning customers I want them to quickly be able to access their wishlisted wines and order history. This will help provide the business user with repeat orders.
For returning customers I want them to be able to review their purchases in such a way as to provide extra incentive for new customers to browse the site and place their first orders.
